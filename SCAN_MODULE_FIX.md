# Scan Module Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

1. **useLatestScan Empty Error Object**: 
   - The hook was throwing errors with empty objects which weren't properly handled
   - Error messages showed up in the console: `Error: Error fetching latest scan: {}`

2. **Progress Component Dependency Issue**:
   - Modified the Progress component to remove Radix dependency
   - Implemented a pure React version with proper styling

3. **Missing Scan Tables in Supabase**:
   - Added proper setup for scan-related database tables

## Components Added/Modified

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in useLatestScan.ts
- Added proper JSON serialization of errors
- Added more detailed error messages
- Implemented better type checking

### 2. Created Fallback Components
- Added `ScanStatusFallback.tsx` to handle error states gracefully
- Created `LatestScanCard.tsx` as a more robust version of the scan status display

### 3. Created Setup Infrastructure
- Added API route `setup-scan-tables` to create necessary Supabase tables
- Added script `setup-scan-tables.js` to run during deployment or initial setup
- Added npm scripts to package.json: `setup:scan-tables` and `setup:all`

## How to Use

### To Fix the Database Tables:
Run the setup script to create the required scan tables in Supabase:

```bash
npm run setup:scan-tables
```

### To Run a Complete Setup:
To set up all required infrastructure including users and scan tables:

```bash
npm run setup:all
```

## Technical Details

### Scan Results Table Schema
The scan_results table has the following structure:
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `created_at`: Timestamp when scan was started
- `completed_at`: Timestamp when scan finished
- `status`: Enum ('running', 'completed', 'failed')
- `error`: Text field for error messages
- `total_domains`: Integer count of all domains scanned
- `domains_needing_attention`: Integer count of domains with issues
- `scan_duration_ms`: Integer duration of scan in milliseconds
- `scan_result`: JSONB field containing full scan results
- `status_breakdown`: JSONB field with domain status breakdown
- `non_active_domains`: JSONB field with list of problem domains

### Implementation Details
The error handling in `useLatestScan` and `useBackgroundScan` hooks has been improved to:
1. Properly log and propagate error details
2. Manage error states in the UI with fallback components
3. Prevent app crashes by catching and handling exceptions properly

## Next Steps
- Add more robust error handling for API routes
- Implement retry logic for failed database operations
- Add unit tests for scan-related functionality
